# Fashion-MNIST
It uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset and classifies the clothes into different categories(multiclass classification) using the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) and keras library. Our model achieved an accuracy of 90.3% on the test set. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images-consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28*28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
